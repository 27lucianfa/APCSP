	<h3>This is Piedmont High School. I love my school. I love challenging myself with harder classes like APCSP and Honors Chinese. Those are just some of my challenging classes. Outside of the classroom I spend my time at Basketball practice. Each weeknight from 8-9:30 I practice Basketball with my team. I love Basketball so much. While it is hard to balance it all I still manage. Im glad I am willing to work hard because I know it will all pay off.</h3>
